# NASA API
A simple website that utilizes NASA's API to allows users to input a date and get NASA's picture of the day.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

One of the first projects I got the opportunity to see that power of APIS. The site was built using an API from https://api.nasa.gov/ (Check them out! They are doing some work that is...out of this world...). The HTML and CSS was built from the ground up. The image was rounded off using CSS. 

## Optimizations

Eventually I will revisit this website to add more functionality such as a random date generator, a photo carousel and intigrate more APIs from NASA 

## Lessons Learned:

This project was very eye opening. It was the first time I started to get the glimpse of the power of JS and APIs. I remember thinking "I finally got this whole progamming thing figured out"..... little did I know... (but in a good way!)
